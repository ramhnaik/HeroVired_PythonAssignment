# Graded Assignment on Python

## Q1: Create a Python script to check the password strength. 

●       Implement a Python function called check_password_strength that takes a password string as input.

●       The function should check the password against the following criteria:

      ○       Minimum length: The password should be at least 8 characters long.

      ○       Contains both uppercase and lowercase letters.

      ○       Contains at least one digit (0-9).

      ○       Contains at least one special character (e.g., !, @, #, $, %).

●       The function should return a boolean value indicating whether the password meets the criteria.

●       Write a script that takes user input for a password and calls the check_password_strength function to validate it.

●       Provide appropriate feedback to the user based on the strength of the password.
